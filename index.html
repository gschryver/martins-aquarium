        <p>Greetings, and welcome to <strong>Martin's Aquarium!</strong></p>
        <p>Here I'll talk about the great variety of fish that I've harvested in my travels, as well as the exotic locations that I've visited in order to harvest them.</p>
        <p>Please have a look around, and feel free to <a href="#">contact</a> me with any and all questions that you may have! Please enjoy the site and my fish as much as I do. And with that, I shall leave you with some words of wisdom:</p>

        <h3 class="aside-heading">Keep your tank freshy-fresh.</h3>
        <p>An aquarium can be a beautiful addition to any room, with crystal clear water, colorful corals, vibrant plants and elegant fish. </p>
        <p>When that aquarium gets dirty, however, it can quickly become an eyesore with murky water, overgrown algae, floating debris and sickly fish. </p>
        <p>Fortunately, there are easy ways to keep your aquarium sparkling.</p>
  
        <ul>
          <li>
            <h4 class="aside-list-heading">Use a Proper Filter</h4>
            The best way to keep an aquarium clean is with a proper filter for the tank's type and size.
          </li>
  
          <li>
            <h4 class="aside-list-heading">Change the Water Regularly</h4>
            As water gets dirty it is less attractive and can be unhealthy for your fish. Changing 20-30 percent of the water every few weeks can help keep it clear.
          </li>
  
          <li>
            <h4 class="aside-list-heading">Feed Fish Correctly</h4>
            Overfeeding your fish will leave leftover food to decay in the tank, causing algae growth and unsanitary water.
          </li>
  
          <li>
            <h4 class="aside-list-heading">Welcome an Algae Eater</h4>
            If your tank grows algae excessively, you can use an algae eater such as a snail or certain species of catfish to help control the accumulation.
          </li>
  
          <li>
            <h4 class="aside-list-heading">Take Time to Clean the Tank</h4>
            A little elbow grease is essential to keep your aquarium at its cleanest. Use a scraper to remove excess algae from the glass, and vacuum the gravel when debris accumulates. Trim away dead leaves from aquatic plants, and wipe algae off props and decorations. A little work will make a big difference in your aquarium's appearance.
          </li>
  
          <li>
            <h4 class="aside-list-heading">Clean the Outside of the Tank</h4>
            The outside of an aquarium is often neglected, but dust and fingerprints can quickly obscure the surface and make the tank seem dirtier than it really is. Use streak-free cleaner to clean the glass and other surfaces periodically, but take care that no chemicals come in contact with the water or the fish could be harmed.
